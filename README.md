Abstract: The evaluation of clinical study data is highly regulated. Up to now data gets analyzed by SAS tools or validated special purpose software. R is a new player in the field. Validating R outputs against SAS can be hard, due to different data formats and data storage. RTest is an open-source tool that allows testing R outputs against XML. This standard format can handle .NET, Java or SAS software outputs. Roche applied the tool to test R-packages against SAS or Analyse-it outputs. Those packages perform tasks like method comparison and Variance Component Analysis. This presentation will show how to generate SAS results. Afterwards, compare the SAS results to R function outputs in an easy manner. RTest creates pretty human-readable outputs from the comparison. This allows overcoming most challenges of validating R and using it in a regulated field.
